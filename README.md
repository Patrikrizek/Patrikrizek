### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am an enthusiastic Front-end Developer eager to contribute to team success through hard work, attention to detail and excellent organizational skills. I am proficient in JavaScript, React, CSS and HTML. I use external libraries such as Bootstrap or Chakra and for website & and mobile app UX/UI designs I use Figma. In my current remote/Hybrid employment, I contribute to the content creation of coding sessions as well as the delivery of coding courses.

ðŸ’» You can check some of my projects on my [Web portfolio](https://patrikrizek.github.io/).
